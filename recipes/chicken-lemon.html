    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This lemony Mediterranean-style chicken is one of my favorite family recipes. I remember my mom would always make this when people would come over.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <li><ul></li>
        <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
        <li>¼ cup olive oil</li>
        <li>4 large cloves garlic, pressed</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons fresh lemon zest</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>¾ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon coarsely ground black pepper</li>
        <li>8 baby red potatoes, halved</li>
        <li>1 red bell pepper, cut into 1-inch wide strips</li>
        <li>1 red onion, cut into 1-inch wedges</li>
        <li>1 lemon, thinly sliced</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Place chicken breasts into a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
        <li>Whisk olive oil, garlic, lemon juice, lemon zest, oregano, salt, and pepper together in a bowl. Brush some of the mixture onto chicken.</li>
        <li>Place potatoes, bell pepper, onion, and lemon slices into a bowl; pour in remaining lemon juice mixture and toss to coat. Arrange vegetables and lemon slices around chicken in the baking dish.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes. Brush chicken and vegetables with the pan drippings. Continue to bake until chicken is browned, the juices run clear, and an instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of a breast reads at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C), about 30 more minutes.</li>
    </ol>
